# Coder Academy Admissions Test

## WHY?
Coding is hard, so is the Fast Track Bootcamp. 
Success at coding comes down to many of the elements that contribute to making a person good at anything: hard work, focus, conscientiousness and grit.
 
## THE TEST
To complete this test you are encouraged to use whatever resources you can (the internet has a wealth of information). Resourcefulness is a valuable skill in coding.

As you work through the different parts of the test, keep notes on how things went: what worked, where you got stuck, how you overcame a roadblock and what resources you used (websites, friends etc). There may be parts of the test you don’t complete, that’s ok, make a note of what happened and move on to the next step.
